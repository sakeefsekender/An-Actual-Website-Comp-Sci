# Basketball is the Best Sport
## Reasons why Basketball is the Best
Basketball is the best sport mainly because of how competitive it is. The struggle and trimph a person faces after overcoming a challenge is what makes this sport the best. On top of that, basketball can test you a lesson. The lesson of never giving up no matter what. Finally, basketball provides excitement in a person's life. For me, Basketball is what I look forward to everyday. It is something that I will never give up. 
### Famous Players
Basketball inhabits some of the greatest athletes of all time. ***Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Magic Johsnon, Shaquille O'neil, Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Oden Polynice, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, and many more***. But most of all, these players use their fame and wealth wisely. They help the weaker people around them and support third world country's by donating large sums of money. That is why I respect these players and others respect them as well. All of this positive change was possible because of basketball. The technical qualities that goes into developing a star helps a player both on and off the court.

#### In the end....
Basketball will forever be part of my life. It is a sport that will never go away and continue to develop throughout the years. It is one sport that will continue to benefit society and lift them to greater heights. But it all has to start on the court with the rock in your hands.
